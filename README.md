# Simple-ML-models
Implementations of simple machine learning models: k-nearest neighbours, naive bayes classifier, single perceptron, 
single layer network of perceptrons

knn - classify vector from iris dataset
naive bayes - classify vector from outdoor game dataset
perceptron - classify vector from iris dataset (setosa or other)
single layer network - classify language of given text file (English, Esperanto, Spanish or German). Each perceptron is responsible for recognizing single language
